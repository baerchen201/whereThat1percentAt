Don't you hate it when there's 1% of Corruption/Crimson/Hallow remaining in your world and you can't find it?
This mod aims to prevent such frustration by adding items to track down the Corruption/Crimson/Hallow biomes.

Features:
 - Crimson/Corruption/Hallow Compass (Info accessory)
 - Crimson/Corruption/Hallow magic mirrors (Teleport you near the biomes)
To-Do:
 - Map highlighting (this already took me way too long and its still not done, fix your documentation tmodloader)
 - Fix percentages (Rainbow Compass)
