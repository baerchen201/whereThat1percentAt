Don't you hate it when there's 1% of Corruption/Crimson/Hallow remaining in your world and you can't find it?
This mod aims to prevent such frustration by adding items to track down the Corruption/Crimson/Hallow biomes.

Features:
 - Crimson/Corruption/Hallow Compass (Info accessory)
 - Crimson/Corruption/Hallow magic mirrors (Teleport you near the biomes)
To-Do:
 - Map highlighting (this already took me way too long and its still not done, fix your documentation tmodloader)
 - Fix percentages (Rainbow Compass)

Version: v0.6.0.1
  Changes:
   - Clean up code
   - Fix some localization issues
   - Remove old code
   - Rename items in code
      Any Items created before this version will still function, however they
      will not recieve localization updates and can not be used in recipes.
      This may be fixed in a future update, please don't report this as a bug.
